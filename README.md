## Negotiation Game Theory

The method used within this experiment is largely based upon the 'iterated ultimatum game (iUG)', an experimental game previously used by Shaw et al. (2018) among others 
(more info here - https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-29233-9). The idea is that pairs of participants negotiate over the division of a sum of money (100kr). 
Participants occupy the role of either 'proposer' or 'responder'. Roles are changed after every 5 negotiation rounds, with 20 rounds in total.

The videos (both those captured on Zoom and in the lab) are of varying lengths, with negotiation exchanges not limited by time restrictions. This means that segmentation 
of the videos, based on individual negotiation rounds, for example, can be extremely challenging. However, an effort was previously made to provide timestamps for each set 
of 5 rounds for the face-to-face videos. See Excel document 'Ultimatum Game Video Segmentation'. 
This document is not complete and the zoom videos are missing. In its current state it adds little benefit. 

All videos are in .mp4 format. However, the video quality varies across the two conditions. For example, the videos captured in the lab were recorded under lighting conditions, 
with the same Axis IP cameras used for all dyads. This was not the case for the Zoom videos. Some of the recordings are therefore better quality than others (potentially due to 
camera resolution, network latency and so on...). 

Audio is available for all recordings taken via Zoom. Audio is not available for some of the video recordings taken in the lab (see 'Ultimatum Game Video Segmentation' 
Excel document for further details on which videos specifically). The loss of audio recording occurred due to an undetected fault with the microphone.

All Zoom recordings have been edited using ‘Camtasia’ software.  The ‘editing’ refers to the cropping of individual videos from the original recordings 
in Zoom (which contained images of both participants).
